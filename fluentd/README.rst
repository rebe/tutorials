FLUENTD
=======

Inside the conf folder, you will find the fluentd xml configuration. In there you
can apply filters, parsers and decide what to do with incoming streams.


::

	tag.record ---->  MATCH  ---------> elasticsearch store

	source --------> FLUENTD ---------> OUTPUT



In this example we wil match any incoming tag and foward it to an elastic search index with the same name.


Assuming your tag is *app* and your record *wirepas* this example will create an index named app.wirepas. In Kibana you can look this index with, eg, app.*.


Starting fluentd
----------------

In this example, the composition for fluentd will created a default network called *fluentd_stream_processing* relies on an external network.

The network will be created by when you start fluentd with


::

	docker-compose up -d


If the composition is successful, your fluentd container will be running in the background and it will be able to process incoming streams on the fluentd_stream_processing network or at the host's ports **24224**.



Customizing fluentd
---------------------
The example in this repository sources the configuration from `fluent.conf`_ which allows for defining the rules which you use to match your inbound streams, which filters to apply and where to route the outbound stream to.

The base for fluentd is inherited from the `official docker image provided by fluentd <https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/>`_. Extra plugins are defined and installed within the `Dockerfile`_.
